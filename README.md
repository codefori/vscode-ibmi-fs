### Adding New Languages

To contribute translations for a new language:

1. Create a new file `l10n/bundle.l10n.<locale>.json` (e.g., `bundle.l10n.fr.json` for French)
2. Copy the structure from `l10n/bundle.l10n.en.json`
3. Translate all values while keeping the keys unchanged
4. Submit a pull request

Translation files use the standard VSCode L10N format where English text serves as the key.
